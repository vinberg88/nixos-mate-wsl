## What is NixOS?

NixOS is a Linux distribution built on the Nix package manager, designed to offer reliable
and reproducible system configurations. Its declarative approach lets you describe your
system configuration in a single file, ensuring consistent environments across different machines.

### Key Features:
- **Declarative Configuration:** Configure your entire system—ranging from services, networking, and user management to packages—using a single plain text file (`configuration.nix`).
- **Atomic Upgrades and Rollbacks:** As changes are transactional, you can revert to a prior state seamlessly.
- **Isolation and Reproducibility:** Packages are built with isolated dependencies, ensuring consistent builds.
- **Extensive Customization:** Modify or create packages without interfering with your system state.

NixOS is ideal for those looking for a highly customizable, reliable, and reproducible system, making it particularly popular among developers, DevOps practitioners, and system administrators.
