## What is NixOS?

NixOS is a Linux distribution built on the Nix package manager, designed to offer reliable
and reproducible system configurations. Its declarative approach lets you describe your
system configuration in a single file, ensuring consistent environments across different machines.

### Key Features:
- **Declarative Configuration:** Configure your entire system—ranging from services, networking, and user management to packages—using a single plain text file (`configuration.nix`).
- **Atomic Upgrades and Rollbacks:** As changes are transactional, you can revert to a prior state seamlessly.
- **Isolation and Reproducibility:** Packages are built with isolated dependencies, ensuring consistent builds.
- **Extensive Customization:** Modify or create packages without interfering with your system state.

NixOS is ideal for those looking for a highly customizable, reliable, and reproducible system, making it particularly popular among developers, DevOps practitioners, and system administrators.

Tools that i USE for WSL - Microsoft - Linux - Windows 11 - 2025

X410 - Xserver for windows 11 - So you have a Desktop.
Do you want to seamlessly use Linux GUI apps side by side with Windows
apps? Simply start X410 and adjust a few settings; your Linux GUI
apps then suddenly appear in Windows and you can use them like Windows 
apps! It doesn't matter where your Linux GUI apps are actually
running; it can be a full virtual machine, Docker container, WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux) or whatever. As long as your Linux GUI
apps support X-Window client protocols, you can use them in Windows.
You can even securely use your Linux GUI apps running in a far remote
server via any SSH client that supports X11 forwarding over the Internet.
